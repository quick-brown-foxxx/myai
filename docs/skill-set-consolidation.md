# Skill Set Consolidation

## Goal

Build one unified, language-agnostic skill set by cherry-picking from four sources, resolving conflicts, merging overlaps, and generalizing Python-specific rules into core principles. The result is complemented by framework-specific skill sets per project.

## Sources

| Source        | Location                              | Count | Style                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Personal      | `skills/`                             | 5     | Pragmatic, lightweight, language-agnostic |
| Superpowers   | `.tmp/superpowers/skills/`            | 14    | Dogmatic, Iron Laws, heavy ceremony, TDD  |
| Addy (Google) | `.tmp/addy-agent-skills/skills/`      | 22    | Balanced, web/TS-focused, practical       |
| Python        | `.tmp/my_coding_rules_python/skills/` | 11    | Strict but pragmatic, Python-specific     |

## Design Principles

### Skills describe generic workflow, but meta-workflow will be added later on the layer above the skills

Skills recommend workflow and contain knowledge, but there will be also higher level meta-workflow added later.

For example, skills contain workflow steps such as planning, debugging, implementation, review, and say when each workflow step should be called.

After the consolidation, there will be added more higher level workflow that will be able to automate bigger tasks than skills now can handle.

### Ceremony scales with task size

Small tasks with clear intent get quick independent planning step. A big feature already brainstormed in the same chat should not require user to interactively re-plan from scratch only because "planning" skill sets hard rule to do this. The skill offers the process; the user or workflow decides the ceremony level.

### Hard gates and Iron Laws: minimal, targeted

Not banned entirely, but used sparingly. Legitimate example use case: **fail fast on environmental conditions**. If a skill requires certain env conditions and they're missing, the skill should tell the agent to stop and notify the orchestrator rather than work around it silently.

Examples of legitimate hard stops:
- API is down → stop, don't try to start the API yourself, escalate or delegate
- Docker broken → stop, don't try to fix Docker
- Browser MCP not installed → stop, don't replace with curl
- Config broken and can't be worked around sanely → stop

Another case for failing fast is situation when given task is too ambiguous or incorrect, something is missing, code broken, other unexpected problems. Why this matters? If agent is given a task and it will try to achieve the result regardless of the real state of the code, it may produce severe hallucinations instead of a usable result, and all its work will be rollbacked or reimplemented anyway.

Examples:
- user asks agent to do a research of feature implementation, but feature misses in source code because of the wrong current commit. Agent should fail fast instead of trying to do analysis on incorrect code
- orchestrator delegates a subagent to do browser verification of a task, and subagent discovers that feature is not present in deployed front end. Instead of trying to verify something else, it should report to orchestrator back that the feature is missing
- user asks agent to do a feature, but user gives too small description of a feature and recommendations are ambiguous and agent can't clearly understand what user wants him to do. It's better to clarify than to proceed blindly

### Hierarchical context isolation

Team lead (human or main AI) → teammates (large isolated tasks) → subagents (small focused actions). Skills are consumed by whichever layer is active. Skills recommend the hierarchy.

### Workflow alignment

The workflow is hierarchical, explicit, and deterministic. It is skill-driven. Workflow phases: high-level task design → detailed implementation planning → implementation → verification/fixing loop (majority of effort) → fresh-context re-verification (multiple times). Separate high level workflow docs will be created later.

## Conflict & Overlap Analysis

| Ideation      | Superpowers `brainstorming` vs Addy `idea-refine`                         | Both 3-phase ideation but different flows. Superpowers has HARD GATE, Addy is flexible                      | Split into `idea-sharpening` for strategic ideation and `brainstorming` for technical specs                |

Superpowers is deep, Addy is broader/shallower                                | Merge: Superpowers root-cause-first + Addy triage + error patterns. Drop pressure tests                    |
| Review        | Superpowers `requesting`+`receiving-code-review` vs Addy `code-review`    | Superpowers splits requesting/receiving + subagent pattern. Addy has 5-axis review in one skill             | Merge: Addy 5-axis + Superpowers verify-before-implementing-feedback. Drop mandatory subagent pattern      |
| Meta          | Superpowers `using-superpowers` vs Addy `using-agent-skills`              | Both define how to discover/load skills                                                                     | Merge into one lightweight bootstrap skill                                                                 |
| Skill writing | Yours `how-to-write-skills` vs Superpowers `writing-skills`               | Yours is practical and portable. Superpowers is TDD-for-skills (655 lines)                                  | Keep yours as primary. Superpowers has some useful bits (discoverability, CSO) — cherry-pick if needed     |

| testing-python + TDD                                        | testing-python defines WHAT good tests look like. TDD defines WHEN to write them. Orthogonal |
| doubt-early + any skill                                     | Apply at any phase: doubt your spec, doubt your plan, doubt your implementation              |
| source-driven-development + any implementation skill        | "Check docs, not memory" applies everywhere                                                  |

## Philosophy Conflicts

| Conflict         | Your position (Python `.tmp/.../PHILOSOPHY.md`)                | Third-party position                                                                 | Resolution                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Testing priority | E2e first, real over mocked, 20/80, trustworthiness > coverage | Superpowers TDD: unit test first, always. Addy TDD: red-green-refactor default       | Your testing philosophy → `ENGINEERING-PHILOSOPHY.md`. TDD is a technique within that philosophy                       |
| Process gates    | prototype-first: "isolate, spike, capture outcome, move on"    | Superpowers: HARD GATE before implementation, 9-step brainstorming                   | Should check superpower's hard gate rules.                                                                             |
| Ceremony level   | "Do not turn verification into ritual"                         | Superpowers: Iron Laws, rationalization tables, pressure tests, 300-line enforcement | Principles over enforcement. Keep useful core idea, drop persuasive apparatus                                          |
| Agent autonomy   | After high-level agreement, agent should execute independently | Superpowers: agent stops to verify plan at every phase transition                    | Ceremony scales with task size. Clear high-level direction = less check-ins. Fails fast early if can't proceed clearly |

  ### Source skill inventory (across all 3b skills)

  | Target Skill                   | SP Source                                      | Addy Source                  | Python Source               | SP Aux                       |

  ### Subtask breakdown per group

  #### Group 1: `verification-before-completion` — quick win, build momentum ✓

  - [x] Read SP source skill, compare with existing engineering-philosophy.md (testing philosophy)
  - [x] Reviewed options: tone (forceful vs technical), scope (standalone vs embedded), overlap with philosophy doc, gate function style
  - [x] Added "When Verification Fails Repeatedly" section — converging vs diverging validation loop, escalation pattern, doubt-early reference
  - [x] Updated Red Flags + Rationalization tables with diverging-loop patterns
  - [x] Write final \`skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md\`

  #### Group 2: `systematic-debugging` — split into 3 skills ✓

  - [x] Decision: split into 3 skills (systematic-debugging + bug-root-cause-tracing + bug-protection-multi-layered)
  - [x] Created design doc: `docs/debugging-skills-design.md`
  - [x] SP `root-cause-tracing.md` → rewritten as standalone `skills/bug-root-cause-tracing/SKILL.md` (language-agnostic, cross-refs)
  - [x] SP `defense-in-depth.md` → rewritten as standalone `skills/bug-protection-multi-layered/SKILL.md` (4-layer pattern, language-agnostic)
  - [x] SP `systematic-debugging/SKILL.md` + Addy `debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md` → merged as `skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md`
  - [x] Discarded SP aux: condition-based-waiting.md + .ts, find-polluter.sh, CREATION-LOG.md, test-*.md
  - [x] Review all 3 skills: match quality bar of existing skills

  #### Group 3: `code-review` — three sources, critical quality gate

  - [ ] Compare Addy (what: 5-axis review, checklist, sizing) vs SP requesting (when/how: subagent dispatch) vs SP receiving (psychology: verify before implement, no performative agreement)
  - [ ] Identify merge plan: Addy's 5-axis as core framework + SP receiving as "how to handle feedback" section + SP requesting distilled to "when to request review" (subagent boilerplate → generic pattern)
  - [ ] Embed \`code-reviewer.md\` aux as a template block in the main skill body (not separate file)
  - [ ] Note cross-link: security section references \`security-and-hardening\` skill, performance references \`performance-optimization\`
  - [ ] Write \`skills/code-review/SKILL.md\`
  - [ ] Review: matches quality bar of existing skills

  #### Group 4: `incremental-implementation` — single real source, straightforward

  - [ ] Read Addy \`incremental-implementation\` as primary source
  - [ ] Verify SP \`executing-plans\` has no useful content to merge (thin meta-process, just delegation)
  - [ ] Align with existing \`planning-implementation\` skill (they're adjacent: planning vs execution)
  - [ ] Write \`skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md\`
  - [ ] Review: matches quality bar

  #### Group 5: `git-workflow` — two complementary sources

  - [ ] Compare Addy (general: trunk-based, atomic commits, branching, hygiene) vs SP (specific: worktree isolation)
  - [ ] Identify merge plan: Addy as core content + SP's worktree section absorbed as one technique chapter
  - [ ] Note cross-link: commit message conventions reference code-review, pre-commit hygiene references CI-CD
  - [ ] Write \`skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md\`
  - [ ] Review: matches quality bar

  #### Group 6: `finishing-a-development-branch` — needs de-SP-ification

  - [ ] Read SP source, identify worktree-heavy dependencies
  - [ ] Generalize: replace worktree-specific commands with generic git branch finish flow
  - [ ] Ensure integration with \`git-workflow\` skill (they naturally chain)
  - [ ] Write \`skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md\`
  - [ ] Review: matches quality bar

  #### Group 7: `architecting-changes` — most complex, generalize from Python

  - [ ] Read Python \`architecting-python-changes\` as base
  - [ ] Split core heuristics vs router function: heuristics largely duplicate ENGINEERING-PHILOSOPHY.md → reference rather than restate
  - [ ] Generalize Python-specific references (setting-up-python-projects, etc.) to language-agnostic (setting-up-projects, etc.) or drop them
  - [ ] The real value: the "classify → route → deeper skill" pattern — make this the centerpiece
  - [ ] Check which Batch 5 Python skills need to exist before this can route to them
  - [ ] Write \`skills/architecting-changes/SKILL.md\`
  - [ ] Review: matches quality bar
- [ ] Batch 4: parallel/agent skills
- [ ] Batch 5: Python skill set refactoring
- [ ] Batch 6: using-skills bootstrap + how-to-write-skills review
- [ ] Workflow documentation (separate from skills)
- [x] Extract `visual-mockups` as standalone aux skill (in-browser UI mockups for brainstorming/spec phase)
